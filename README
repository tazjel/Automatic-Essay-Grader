ABSTRACT
AUTOMATIC ESSAY GRADER

Almost everything in this world is automated; however grading subjective answers and
essays is - painfully - done manually. Automatic Evaluation and Grading of English

Essays, therefore, is relevant, both, socially and technologically.
The techniques employed to achieve this encompass, not only a vast area of computer
science: bringing Data Mining, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
under its radar, but also some ‘abstract aspects’ of the English language and grammar;
the subtle points such as the deviation from the central topic, structure of the sentences,
etc., that help determine the qualities of a good essay.

The scope of this project is, therefore, to explore various techniques tha may be used to
evaluate an essay and to develop a system which will automatically grade an English
essay based on: Spelling, Grammar, Coherence, Frequent Phrases and Vocabulary. The
system will then produce a score report and statistics of the essay.


NOTE: The project is currently being worked on and a lot of features are yet to be implemented...
