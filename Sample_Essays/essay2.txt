Automated essay scoring is unfair to students, since there are many different ways for a student to express ideas intelligently and coherently. A computer program can not be expected to anticipate all of these possibilities, and will therefore grade students more harshly than they deserve. Discuss whether you agree or disagree (partially or totally) with the view expressed providing reasons and examples.

Computers are stupid. the shoulnt be allowed to grade peoples essays.

i had this computers once that was so stupid it was stupider than my dog and tats pretty stupid. My dog was so dump that he once ate his own droppings dogs are suptid.

My dog wood grade esays better than a computer even thou he once hate my homework. Teacher did not believe me when I told her that Ace had eated my homework so teachers are stupid too.

Evan stupider than dogs are fish they just swim around in the bowl and don't do anything sometimes they don't even swim much and just sit there i hate fish except for eating them.

I hate computers almost as much as i hate fish. fish should not grade esays and computers shouldnt grade essaiys.
